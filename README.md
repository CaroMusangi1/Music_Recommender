Technology Choices and Alternatives:

FlASK VS DJANGO

Trade-offs
-Flask is lightweight and minimalistic, making it easier to get started and more flexible for smaller projects.
-Django is a more comprehensive framework with built-in features like authentication, ORM, and admin interface, which can be overkill for this project.

Decision
Flask was chosen because it allows for greater flexibility and simplicity, fitting well with the project's scope and requirements. Its modularity also makes it easier to integrate with the chosen frontend framework, React.

REACT  VS. ANGULAR
Trade-offs
-React offers a component-based architecture, which promotes reusability and easier state management. It also has a larger community and more resources available.
-Angular is a complete framework with a steeper learning curve and more built-in functionalities, which can be advantageous for larger, more complex applications.
Decision
React was chosen for its ease of use, flexibility, and the team's familiarity with it. Its large ecosystem and robust community support also contributed to this decision.
